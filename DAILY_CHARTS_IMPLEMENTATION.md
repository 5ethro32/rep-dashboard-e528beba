# Daily Rep Performance Charts Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of chart visualizations in the DailyRepPerformance page, adapted from the original RepPerformance page visualizations.

## Implementation Summary

### New Components Created

1. **DailyProfitDistribution** (`src/components/daily-rep-performance/DailyProfitDistribution.tsx`)
   - Bar chart showing profit distribution across reps
   - Sorted by highest profit first
   - Shows top 8-10 reps with initials
   - Includes change indicators when comparison data is available
   - Tooltip shows detailed rep information

2. **DailyMarginComparison** (`src/components/daily-rep-performance/DailyMarginComparison.tsx`)
   - Bar chart comparing margin percentages across reps
   - Sorted by highest margin first
   - Blue gradient bars (consistent with original design)
   - Change indicators for margin changes
   - Detailed tooltips with revenue and profit data

3. **DailyRepProfitShare** (`src/components/daily-rep-performance/DailyRepProfitShare.tsx`)
   - Donut chart showing profit share percentage by rep
   - Uses red color gradient to match original design
   - Groups small values (<1%) into "Others" category
   - Responsive design with different layouts for mobile/desktop
   - Shows rep initials in legend for space efficiency

4. **DailyDepartmentProfitShare** (`src/components/daily-rep-performance/DailyDepartmentProfitShare.tsx`)
   - Donut chart showing profit distribution by department
   - Respects department filters (Retail, REVA, Wholesale)
   - Consistent red color theme
   - Dynamic based on selected departments

### Data Hook Created

**useDailyRepPerformanceData** (`src/hooks/useDailyRepPerformanceData.tsx`)
- Fetches data from Daily_Data table in Supabase
- Provides aggregated data for charts:
  - `repTableData`: Rep-level metrics (revenue, profit, margin, orders)
  - `departmentData`: Department-level aggregated metrics
  - `summary`: Overall summary metrics
- Handles date range and filter management
- Supports comparison data (placeholder for future implementation)

### Integration with DailyRepPerformance Page

The charts are integrated in a 2x2 grid layout:
```
+------------------------+------------------------+
| Profit Distribution    | Margin Comparison      |
| (Bar Chart)            | (Bar Chart)            |
+------------------------+------------------------+
| Profit Share by Rep    | Profit Share by Dept   |
| (Donut Chart)          | (Donut Chart)          |
+------------------------+------------------------+
```

### Key Differences from RepPerformance

1. **Data Source**: Uses Daily_Data table instead of monthly aggregated data
2. **Filters**: Includes EDI/Telesales method filters in addition to department filters
3. **Date Range**: Uses date picker for flexible date ranges instead of fixed months
4. **Comparison**: Simplified comparison logic (to be enhanced in future phases)
5. **Real-time**: Data fetches on filter/date changes vs pre-loaded monthly data

### Design Consistency

- Maintained same visual styling as RepPerformance page
- Consistent color schemes (red gradients for profit, blue for margins)
- Same card styling with glass morphism effect
- Responsive design patterns preserved
- Tooltip interactions and change indicators match original

### Performance Considerations

- Data is fetched and aggregated on-demand
- Memoized calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Limited chart data points for better performance (top 10 reps)
- Efficient grouping of small values into "Others" category

### Future Enhancements

1. Implement proper period-over-period comparison data
2. Add animation transitions for data changes
3. Export functionality for charts
4. Drill-down capabilities on chart interactions
5. Advanced filtering options
6. Mobile-specific optimizations for chart interactions
