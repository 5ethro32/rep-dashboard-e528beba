# Chart Debug Instructions

## Quick Test

### 1. First, try this URL:
**http://localhost:8080/test-basic**

This bypasses authentication. You should see:
- "TEST PAGE - If you can read this, React routing works!"
- Red text saying "This is red text"
- A blue box

### 2. If test-basic doesn't work:
The issue is more fundamental. Check:
- Is the server running on port 8080?
- Try opening http://localhost:8080 directly
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### 3. If test-basic works:
You need to log in first:
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/auth
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Then try http://localhost:8080/daily-rep-performance-demo

### 4. Check Browser Console
Press F12 and look for:
- Red error messages
- Failed to load module errors
- Authentication errors

### 5. Server Check
The dev server should be running on port 8080. You can verify by going to:
- http://localhost:8080

Let me know:
1. Does /test-basic work?
2. Are you logged in?
3. What errors do you see in the console?
