# AG Grid Migration Plan for Inventory Analytics

## Overview
This plan outlines the migration of all inventory analytics tabs from custom React tables to AG Grid components for improved performance, consistency, and user experience.

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Overstock Tab Migration ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Replace the existing `OverstockAnalysis` component with `OverstockAGGrid`

**Implementation Details**:
- **Base Component**: ✅ Copied `AllItemsAGGrid` component entirely
- **Data Source**: ✅ Uses `data.overstockItems` instead of `data.analyzedItems`
- **Columns**: ✅ Maintains ALL existing columns from All Items AG Grid
- **Filtering**: ✅ Keeps all strategic filters (velocity, trend, winning, NBP, stock qty)
- **Functionality**: ✅ Preserves all existing features:
  - Sorting on all columns
  - Advanced filtering with dropdown selections
  - Search functionality
  - Star/unstar items
  - Export capabilities
  - Pagination
  - Responsive design
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Component created and integrated

### Phase 2: Priority Issues Tab Migration ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Replace `PriorityIssuesAnalysis` with `PriorityIssuesAGGrid`

**Implementation Details**:
- **Base Component**: ✅ Copied `AllItemsAGGrid` component
- **Data Source**: ✅ Uses `data.priorityIssues` instead of `data.analyzedItems`  
- **Additional Columns**: ✅ Added unique columns:
  - **Issue Type** (pinned left, purple color, centered)
  - **Severity** (pinned left, color-coded: critical=red, high=orange, medium=yellow, low=blue)
- **All Items Columns**: ✅ Maintains ALL columns from All Items AG Grid
- **Features**: ✅ All AG Grid features preserved
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Component created and integrated

### Phase 3: Watchlist Tab Migration ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Replace `WatchlistAnalysis` with `WatchlistAGGrid`

**Implementation Details**:
- **Base Component**: ✅ Copied `AllItemsAGGrid` component  
- **Data Source**: ✅ Filters `data.analyzedItems` where `item.watchlist === '⚠️'`
- **Columns**: ✅ Same as All Items (no additional columns needed)
- **Features**: ✅ All AG Grid features maintained
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Component created and integrated

### Phase 4: Starred Items Tab Migration ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Replace `StarredItemsAnalysis` with `StarredItemsAGGrid`

**Implementation Details**:
- **Base Component**: ✅ Copied `AllItemsAGGrid` component
- **Data Source**: ✅ Filters `data.analyzedItems` where `starredItems.has(item.id)`
- **Columns**: ✅ Same as All Items (no additional columns needed)
- **Features**: ✅ All AG Grid features maintained
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Component created and integrated

## ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE

### Summary of Achievements

**All 4 tabs now use AG Grid:**
1. **All Items** - ✅ Already implemented
2. **Overstock** - ✅ Migrated successfully  
3. **Priority Issues** - ✅ Migrated with additional columns
4. **Watchlist** - ✅ Migrated successfully
5. **Starred Items** - ✅ Migrated successfully

### Key Benefits Delivered

1. **Consistent User Experience**: All tabs now have the same look, feel, and functionality
2. **Enhanced Performance**: AG Grid provides superior performance for large datasets
3. **Advanced Features**: All tabs now include:
   - Professional pagination with customizable page sizes
   - Advanced column filtering and sorting
   - Search functionality across all data
   - Export capabilities (CSV, Excel)
   - Column resizing and reordering
   - Row selection and multi-selection
   - Tooltip support
   - Responsive design
4. **Maintainability**: Shared component architecture reduces code duplication
5. **Scalability**: AG Grid handles large datasets efficiently

### Technical Implementation

**Components Created:**
- `PriorityIssuesAGGrid` - With Issue Type and Severity columns
- `WatchlistAGGrid` - Filtered view of watchlist items
- `StarredItemsAGGrid` - Filtered view of starred items
- `OverstockAGGrid` - Filtered view of overstock items (already completed)

**Components Updated:**
- `TabsContent` - All tab content now uses AG Grid components

**Features Preserved:**
- Star/unstar functionality
- All data points and calculations
- Filtering and sorting logic
- Search capabilities
- Export functionality
- Responsive mobile design

### Next Steps

The migration is now complete. All inventory analytics tabs use AG Grid for a consistent, high-performance user experience.

**Future Enhancements (Optional):**
- Consider adding row grouping for advanced data organization
- Implement custom cell editors for inline editing
- Add advanced charting integration
- Explore server-side filtering for even larger datasets

## Benefits of AG Grid Migration

### Performance Improvements
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Faster rendering and filtering
- Better memory management
- Smooth scrolling experience

### User Experience Enhancements
- Consistent interface across all tabs
- Advanced filtering capabilities
- Better column management
- Improved mobile responsiveness
- Export functionality standardized

### Developer Benefits
- Single source of truth for table logic
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Consistent styling and behaviour
- Reduced code duplication

## Technical Considerations

### Data Consistency
- All components use the same data structure
- Filtering logic preserved for each tab
- Star functionality maintained across all tabs

### Component Structure
- Each AG Grid component is self-contained
- Shared utility functions for formatting
- Consistent prop interfaces

### Styling Consistency
- Same AG Grid theme across all tables
- Consistent cell renderers
- Unified color schemes and indicators

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Performance improved or maintained
- ✅ No data loss or display issues
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness maintained

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ Code is clean and maintainable
- ✅ Components follow established patterns
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ Comprehensive testing completed

---

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- **All Items AG Grid**: ✅ Complete and working
- **Overstock AG Grid**: ✅ Completed
- **Watchlist AG Grid**: ✅ Completed
- **Starred Items AG Grid**: ✅ Completed  
- **Priority Issues AG Grid**: ✅ Completed

### Key Decisions Made
1. Maintain ALL columns from All Items in every tab
2. Keep existing data filtering logic for each tab
3. Preserve all interactive features (star, export, search)
4. Use consistent component naming pattern: `[TabName]AGGrid`
5. No changes to the All Items tab (already complete)

### Risk Mitigation
- Test each migration thoroughly before proceeding to next phase
- Keep backup of original components during development
- Ensure data integrity throughout migration
- Validate all user interactions work correctly
